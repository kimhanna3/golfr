Description: This package provides an efficient algorithm to generate group assignments for classroom settings while minimizing repeated pairings across multiple rounds.
The algorithm uses matrix operations and a conflict score metric to optimize group configurations, offering educators a tool to reduce manual effort in student group allocation.
Functions for generating initial group assignments, updating cumulative interaction matrices, and calculating conflict scores are included.
The package aims to streamline the group assignment process and enhance fairness in classroom collaborations.
Future work includes extending the algorithm for additional criteria, such as balancing skill levels or performance metrics.
